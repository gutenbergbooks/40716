<h3>
<span>CALAMITIES OF AUTHORS.</span>
</h3>


<p class="blockquot">In "N. &amp; Q." of the 17th of this month a correspondent, under the
signature of A S<span class="smcap lowercase">MALL</span> A<span class="smcap lowercase">UTHOR</span>, pointed out, with much humour, and good
humour, the manner in which he had been applied to and induced to part
with certain "theological tomes" to some mysterious but most
"influential" critic. Since that article appeared we have received
information, which shows that the practice complained of is one which is
being carried on to a considerable extent; and we therefore think we
shall be doing some service, both to authors and publishers, by
reprinting in our columns the following correspondence between Messrs.
Butterworth and Sir J. E. Eardley Wilmot on the subject.</p>

<p class="center">(Copies.)</p>

      <p class="right1">Fleet Street, January 2nd, 1852.</p>

<p>Dear Sir,&mdash;Authors with whom we have transactions, as well as ourselves,
have recently been frequently applied to for publications "for the
purpose of review in the daily, and other journals," by a person signing
himself "J<span class="smcap lowercase">OHN</span> B. E<span class="smcap lowercase">ARDLEY</span> W<span class="smcap lowercase">ILMOT</span>;" and as we happen to know, in an
instance that has just occurred, we have been directed by one of our
authors to send his works to the individual making application for the
same under the impression that you were the party who did so, we write
therefore in the first instance, as we have our doubts on the subject,
to inquire if we are correct in presuming it is yourself who proffer the
services of a reviewer, as in such case we shall be happy in sending the
publications applied for, to be noticed accordingly. In the event of the
letter alluded to (and which we send for your inspection) not having
emanated from you, we beg you will further oblige us by stating if you
know anything of the party who signs his name in a manner so similar to
yourself.</p>

<p>Waiting your reply,</p>

      <p class="right1"><span class="right1">We are, dear Sir,</span><br />
      Yours very respectfully,<br />
      (Signed) H. B<span class="smcap lowercase">UTTERWORTH</span> &amp; C<span class="smcap lowercase">O</span>.</p>

      <p class="indh">To Sir J. E. Eardley Wilmot, Bart,<br />
      Barrister at Law, King's Bench Walk, Temple.</p>

<hr class="small" />

 <p class="right1"> Sessions, Warwick, January 5th, 1852.</p>

<p>Dear Sirs,&mdash;I have the honour of acknowledging your letter of the 2nd
inst., which has been forwarded to me here.</p>

<p>I have already on more than one occasion been applied to, to know if I
am the individual who signs himself "J. B. E<span class="smcap lowercase">ARDLEY</span> W<span class="smcap lowercase">ILMOT</span>," and who it
seems is in the habit of writing to publishers, to ask for copies of new
works, for the alleged purpose of getting them reviewed. Not three weeks
ago I found on my table at my chambers in the Temple three very
expensive books, which had been sent to me by Messrs. Longman &amp; Co.,
supposing that I had offered to review them. I am very glad of the
opportunity your letter affords me of stating that the individual who
thus<a id="Page_98"></a>
 <span class="pagenum">[98]</span> signs himself and I myself are totally different persons; I
have no connection or influence whatever with any literary journal, nor
have I ever been a writer in any, and I need scarcely assure you I have
never asked any publisher in my life for a copy of any new work in the
manner adopted by the individual to whom you allude.</p>

<p>I may as well add, that there is no member of my family whose initials
are J. B. Eardley Wilmot, nor is there, to the best of my knowledge, any
family in England, except my own, which combines the two surnames of
Eardley Wilmot. I must therefore presume that the signature of J. B.
Eardley Wilmot is entirely a fictitious one, and adopted for sinister
purposes.</p>

<p>I beg to express my acknowledgments to you, for enabling me to set
myself right with the literary world, more especially as I have lately
brought out a little work of my own on a subject entirely professional.</p>

 <p class="right1"><span class="right1">I am, Gentlemen,</span><br />
       Your obedient Servant,<br />
      (Signed) J. E. E<span class="smcap lowercase">ARDLEY</span> W<span class="smcap lowercase">ILMOT</span>.</p>

 <p class="indh"> To Messrs. Butterworth,<br />
      Law Booksellers and Publishers,<br />
      <span class="right1">Fleet Street, London.</span></p>


<p class="blockquot">We will but add one small fact. An author who had been applied to by
another influential reviewer, the Rev. A. B. Clerk, directed his
publisher to forward a copy of his book <i>by post</i> to the place
specified. The publisher sent it <i>by rail</i>. The consequence was that the
reverend reviewer complained that the book had not reached him: while
the railway people <i>returned it because no such person could be found in
the place at which he professed to reside</i>.</p>

<h3>
<span>PORTRAITS OF WOLFE.</span>
</h3>

<p>As the readers of "N. &amp; Q." seem to take an interest in everything
connected with the celebrated and heroic Wolfe, I may mention that my
family possess two small paintings of that distinguished general, but by
whom painted is unknown, though they are supposed to have been executed
by some officer present with him at the taking of Quebec. A description
of them may not be unacceptable to your readers. One represents Wolfe in
the act of tying a handkerchief round his wrist, after he had been
wounded at the commencement of the battle on the Heights of Abraham;
and, from its unfinished appearance, seems to have been but a <i>première
pensée</i> of the artist,&mdash;Wolfe's figure being the only one finished. The
other represents him leaning on a soldier, just after receiving the
fatal ball which deprived him of life, and his country of one of her
greatest heroes. The family tradition connected with both these
paintings is that they were painted immediately after his death by one
of his aide-de-camps, or by an officer in the forces under his command.
On the panels of the latter painting is the following inscription, some
of the words being partially effaced:</p>

 <p class="blockquot">"This painting represents the death of my [<i>here the words are
   effaced, but, as far as I can make them out, they are</i>] friend
   General Wolfe, who fell on the Heights of Abraham on [<i>nearly
   effaced</i>][the 13th day of September] 1759, before he could
   rejoice in the victory gained that day over the French."</p>

<p>"H. C." or "G." are the initials attached to this inscription, and under
it are written, in old-fashioned style, and in old paper, pasted to the
panels, the following lines, which I transcribe, as I have never seen
them elsewhere:</p>

<div class="poem">

<div class="stanza">

      <p class="noindent">"In the thick of the Fight, Wolfe's plume was display'd,</p>
     <p> And his [<i>effaced</i>] coat was dusty and gory,</p>
    <p class="noindent">As flash'd on high his sabre's blade</p>
                                <p class="i12"> { fell }</p>
        <p>O'er that Field where he { <i>or</i> } with such glory.</p>
                                <p class="i12"> { died }</p>

</div>

<div class="stanza">

    <p class="noindent"> "On Abraham's Heights he fought that day</p>
    <p>    With his soldiers side by side,</p>
             <p class="i3">{   mov'd  }</p>
    <p class="noindent">And he {   <i>or</i>   } along thro' that dreadful fray</p>
          <p class="i3"> { led them }</p>
        <p>As Old England's Hope and Pride.</p>

</div>

<div class="stanza">

    <p class="noindent">"But short was the Hero's immortal career,</p>
       <p> For as the battle was nearly o'er</p>
    <p class="noindent">He fell by a ball from a French musketeer,</p>
       <p> Which bath'd his breast with gore.</p>

</div>

<div class="stanza">

    <p class="noindent">"When wounded he leant on a soldier nigh,</p>
       <p> And the victory just was won,&mdash;</p>
     <p class="noindent"> For he heard aloud the cheering cry,</p>
        <p>'They run! they run! they run!'&mdash;</p>

</div>

<div class="stanza">

    <p class="noindent">"He faintly ask'd from whence that sound,</p>
       <p> And being answer'd, 'The Enemy fly,'</p>
   <p class="noindent">He exclaim'd, as he slowly sunk to the ground,</p>
        <p>'Oh God! in peace I die.'</p>

<h3>
<span>NOTES ON HOMER, NO. I.</span>
</h3>

<p><i>Homeric Literature.</i></p>

<p>There has been a very great difficulty in the world of literature, which
it were almost vain to think of removing. This difficulty is that
usually known as "the Homeric question." After the folios and quartos of
the grand old scholars of antiquity; after the octavos of Wolf, Heyne,
and Knight; after the able chapters of Grote, and the eloquent volumes
of Mure; after the Alexandrian Chorizontes; and after the incidental
reflections on the subject scattered through thousands of volumes, it
seems almost hazardous, and indeed useless, to offer any more
conjectures on "the bard of ages," and (to use the phrase of the
novelists) "his birth, education, and adventures." On a consideration of
the question, however, it will be seen that (strange fact!) the subject
is not yet exhausted; I shall therefore, with your kind assistance,
submit a retrospective view of the matter to the readers of "N. &amp; Q.,"
and afterwards attempt to show what results may be drawn from the united
labour of so many minds. I shall then give a <i>résumé</i>, first, of the
ancient history bearing on Homer, and, continuing the sketch to the late
volumes of Mure, draw my own conclusions, which, after much patient
consideration, I must say, appear to be nearer an approximation to the
truth, than any theory which has yet been promulgated.</p>

<p>Let us cast our eyes on antiquity. This very much misunderstood period
of the earth's progress offers to us the proofs of an appreciation of
Homer to which literary history affords but one parallel. The
magnificent flights of thought, which the Hellenes could so well
accompany, the tone of colouring at once so subdued and so glorious,
gained for the unknown poet a reputation everlasting and world and
age-wide. But as time fled by, there arose a race of men who wrote
poetry as schoolboys do Latin, by judiciously arranging (or <i>vice
versâ</i>) appropriate lines from the earlier poets, called Cyclic poets,
or <i>cento</i>-makers. The men who wrote thus were, probably, persons either
engaged in itinerant vocal pursuits, or regular verse makers, who wrote
"on a subject," as our own street writers on the present day. Indeed, I
may say, that the state of the rhapsodists of Greece resembles much that
of our own "itinerant violinists," as an eminent counsel once
apostrophized the class which the excellent judge on the bench named,
according to general custom, "blin' fiddlers." The probable reason for
the introduction of passages into the original Homeric compositions was
the necessity of a novelty. The Cyclic poems are to Homer what the
letters of Poplicola, Anti-Sejanus, Correggio, Moderator, and the rest,
were to Junius. However, they prove in a remarkable manner how great the
excitement regarding "the poet," as Aristoteles calls him, ever
continued to be in Hellas.</p>

<p>These gentlemen, whose object was not to disgrace Homer by their puling
compositions, but only to practically observe the maxims subsequently
instilled by Iago into Roderigo's mind (viz., to "put money in their
purse"), were the precursors of another race of writers. In ancient
times, we are informed by Tatian,<a id="ian1"></a><a title="Go to footnote 1." href="#fn1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> there were many writers on Homer,
whose works, it is to be lamented, have perished with the nominal
exception of a few fragments,&mdash;though, perhaps, scholars will once learn
to use those as a clue, and find, as Burges did in the case of
Thucydides,<a id="des2"></a><a title="Go to footnote 2." href="#fn2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> that many valuable passages are lying hid in the pages of
the lexicographers, who spared themselves the trouble of writing fresh
matter, by merely slightly changing the expressions of their sources,
and not "bothering" their lexicographical brains by attempting original
composition. It is thus, that even the weaknesses of the human mind
benefit after ages!</p>

<p>The names furnished us by Tatian are these:&mdash;Theagenes of Rhegium (the
earliest writer of whom we are cognizant, contemporary with Cambyses);
Stesimbrotos of Thasos (contemporary with Pericles);<a id="les3"></a><a title="Go to footnote 3." href="#fn3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> Antimachos of
Claros; Herodotos, Dionysios of Olynthos, Ephoros of Cyme; Philochoros

(<span class="smcap lowercase">B.C.</span> 280); Aristophanes of Byzantium (B.C. 264); Callimachus, whose
poetry, by the way, is dryer and more vapid than his prose, if the
little we have left of him allows us to form an opinion; Crates of
Malfus (<span class="smcap lowercase">B.C.</span> 157); Eratosthenes of Cyrene; Aristarchos of Samothrace,
and Apollodoros of Athens. The minds or pens of these men in Hellas
alone, were occupied with this grand subject; and in Rome, that city of
translations and "crib," we find the pens of the scribes were at work,
and prolific in prolixity. Besides these authors, there are others whose
attempts at illustrating the text of the writers of antiquity have been
met in a most<a id="Page_100"></a>
 <span class="pagenum">[100]</span> illiberal manner; I mean the Scholiasts, who have
been treated most unjustly. A goodly host of scribblers looks forth from
the grave of antiquity. And here, before proceeding to speak of the
theories of later times, it may be permitted me to suggest that casual
allusions by writers who write not expressly on the subject, and who are
sufficiently accurate on those points to which they have directed their
attention, are often more valuable than the folios of writers who go on
the principle of book-making.</p>

<p>To enumerate the modern works of Homeric controversy, would be an
endless and tedious task, nay, even useless, when so able and full an
account exists in Engelmann's <i>Bibliotheca Classica</i>. The chief works,
however, are Wolf's <i>Prolegomena</i>; Wood's <i>Essay on the Original Genius

<h3>
<span>FRENCH REVOLUTIONS FORETOLD.</span>
</h3>


<p>It seems strange to find in Dr. Jackson's <i>Works</i> a prophecy which, if
then thought applicable to the French nation, is much more so now. I
have no opportunity of verifying his reference, but will extract all
verbatim, giving the Italics as I find them:&mdash;</p>

<p class="blockquot">"And without prejudice to many noble patriots and worthy members
   of Christ this day living in that famous kingdom of <i>France</i>, I
   should interpret that dream of <i>Bassina (see Aimoinus, aliter
   Annonius) de Gestis Francorum, lib. i. c. 7. &amp; 8. in the Corpus
   Franciæ Histor., Printed in folio, 1613, Hanoviæ</i>, Queen unto
   <i>Childerick</i> the First, of the present state of <i>France</i>: in
   which the last part of that threefold vision is more truly
   verified than it was even in the lineal succession of
   <i>Childerick</i> and <i>Bassina</i>, or any of the <i>Merovingian</i> or
   <i>Carlovingian</i> families. The vision was of three sorts of beasts:
   the <i>first, lions and leopards</i>; the <i>second, bears and wolves</i>;
   the <i>third, of dogs, or lesser creatures</i>, biting and devouring
   one another.</p>

<p class="blockquot">"The interpretation which <i>Bassina</i> made of it was registered
   certain hundred years ago. That these troups of vermin or lesser
   creatures did signifie a people without fear or reverence of
   their princes, so pliable and devoutly obsequious to follow the
   peers or potentates of that nation in their factious quarrels,
   that they should involve themselves in inextricable tumults to
   their own destruction. Had this vision been painted only with
   this general notification, that it was to be <i>emblematically</i>
   understood of some state in Europe: who is he that can discern a
   picture by the known party whom it represents, but could have
   known as easily that this was a map of those miseries that lately
   have befallen <i>France</i>, whose bowels were almost rent and torn
   with civil and domestic broyls? <i>God grant her closed wounds fall
   not to bleed afresh again. And that her people be not so eagerly
   set to bite and tear one another (like dogs or other testie
   creatures) until all become a prey to wolves and bears, or other
   great ravenous beasts</i>, which seek not so much to tear or rent in
   heat of revenge, as lie in wait continually to devour and swallow
   with insatiate greediness the whole bodies of mighty kingdoms,
   and to die her robes, that rides as queen of monsters upon that
   <i>many headed beast</i>, with streams of bloud that issue from the
   bodies squeezed and crushed between their violent teeth; yea,
   even with the <i>royal bloud</i> of kings and princes."<br />

<h3>
<span>IDEES NAPOLEONIENNES.</span>
</h3>

<p>We hear a vast deal in these ages of what are called "Idées
Napoléoniennes," the wisdom of Napoleon, and so forth. Some of this is
invented by the writers, and ascribed to Napoleon; some of it is no
wisdom at all; and some is what may be called second-hand wisdom, an old
familiar face with a new dress. Of the latter sort is the famous saying:</p>

<p class="blockquot">"From the sublime to the ridiculous there is but a step."</p>

<p>For this remark Napoleon has obtained considerable notice: but the truth
is, he borrowed it from Tom Paine; Tom Paine borrowed it from Hugh
Blair, and Hugh Blair from Longinus. Napoleon's words are:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem">

     <p> "Du sublime au ridicule il n'y a qu'un pas."</p>

</div>

<p>The passage in Tom Paine, whose writings were translated into French as
early as 1791, stands thus:&mdash;</p>

<p class="blockquot">"The sublime and the ridiculous are often so nearly related, that
   it is difficult to class them separately; one step above the
   sublime makes the ridiculous, and one step above the ridiculous
   makes the sublime again."</p>


<p>Blair has a remark akin to this:</p>

<p class="blockquot">"It is indeed extremely difficult to hit the precise point where
   true wit ends and buffoonery begins."</p>


<p>But the passage in Blair, from which Tom Paine adopted his notion of the
sublime and the ridiculous, is that in which Blair, commenting on
Lucan's style, remarks:&mdash;<a id="Page_101"></a>
 <span class="pagenum">[101]</span></p>

<p class="blockquot"> "It frequently happens that where the second line is sublime, the
   third, in which he meant to rise still higher, is perfectly
   bombast."</p>


<p>Lastly, this saying was borrowed by Blair from his brother rhetorician,
Longinus, who, in his <i>Treatise on the Sublime</i>, has the following
sentence at the beginning of section iii.:&mdash;</p>

 <p class="blockquot">"<span title="[Tetholôtai gar tê phrasei, kai tethorybêtai tais phantasiais
 mallon, ê dedeinôtai, kan hekaston autôn pros
 augas anaskopês, ek tou phoberou kat' oligon hyponostei
 pros to eukataphronêton.]">&#932;&#949;&#952;&#8057;&#955;&#969;&#964;&#945;&#953; &#947;&#8048;&#961; &#964;&#8135;
 &#966;&#961;&#8049;&#963;&#949;&#953;, &#954;&#945;&#8054; &#964;&#949;&#952;&#959;&#961;&#8059;&#946;&#951;&#964;&#945;&#953;
 &#964;&#945;&#8150;&#962; &#966;&#945;&#957;&#964;&#945;&#963;&#8055;&#945;&#953;&#962;
&#956;&#8118;&#955;&#955;&#959;&#957;, &#7970; &#948;&#949;&#948;&#949;&#8055;&#957;&#969;&#964;&#945;&#953;,
 &#954;&#7938;&#957; &#7957;&#954;&#945;&#963;&#964;&#959;&#957; &#945;&#8016;&#964;&#8182;&#957;
 &#960;&#961;&#8056;&#962;
&#945;&#8016;&#947;&#8048;&#962; &#7936;&#957;&#945;&#963;&#954;&#959;&#960;&#8135;&#962;,
 &#7952;&#954; &#964;&#959;&#8166; &#966;&#959;&#946;&#949;&#961;&#959;&#8166; &#954;&#945;&#964;'
 &#8000;&#955;&#8055;&#947;&#959;&#957; &#8017;&#960;&#959;&#957;&#959;&#963;&#964;&#949;&#8150;
&#960;&#961;&#8056;&#962; &#964;&#8056;
 &#949;&#8016;&#954;&#945;&#964;&#945;&#966;&#961;&#8057;&#957;&#951;&#964;&#959;&#957;.</span>"</p>

<p>This is referred to by Warton in his comments on Pope's translation of
the <i>Thebais of Statius</i>; and Dr. Croly, apparently unacquainted with
the passages in Paine and Blair, describes it, in his edition of Pope,
as the anticipation of Napoleon's celebrated remark. It will be seen
that the original saying, in its various peregrinations, has undergone a
slight modification, Longinus making the translation a gradual one,
"<span title="[Greek: kat' oligon]">&#954;&#945;&#964;' &#8000;&#955;&#8055;&#947;&#959;&#957;</span>," while Blair, Paine, and Napoleon make it but "a
step." Yet, notwithstanding this disguise, the marks of its paternity
are sufficiently traceable.</p>

<p>So much for this celebrated "mot." And, after all, there is very little
wit or wisdom in it, that is not expressed or suggested by La
Rochefoucauld's <i>Maxims</i>:&mdash;</p>

<p class="blockquot">"La plus subtile folie se fait de la plus subtile sagesse."</p>

<p class="blockquot">"Plus on aime une maîtresse, plus on est près de la haïr;"</p>

<p>or by Rousseau's remark&mdash;</p>

<p class="blockquot"> "Tout état qui brille est sur son déclin;"</p>

<p>or by Beaumarchais' exclamation&mdash;</p>

<p class="blockquot"> "Que les gens d'esprit sont bêtes!"</p>

<p>or by the old French proverb&mdash;</p>

<p class="blockquot">  "Les extrêmes se touchent;"</p>

<p>or by the English adage&mdash;</p>

<p class="blockquot">"The darkest hour is nearest the dawn;"</p>

<p>or, lastly, by any of the following passages in our own poets:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem">

                     <p> &mdash;--"Evils that take leave,</p>
      <p>On their departure most of all show evil."</p>

<h3>
<span>DR. JOHNSON'S CONTRIBUTIONS TO BARETTI'S INTRODUCTION.</span>
</h3>


<p>Boswell notices Dr. Johnson having in 1775 written the preface to
Baretti's <i>Easy Lessons in Italian and English</i>; but neither he nor his
editors appear to have been aware of the preface which Dr. Johnson
contributed to an earlier work by Baretti, his <i>Introduction to the
Italian Language</i>, London, 1775, 8vo. It is accompanied by an Italian
translation, and is written with all his usual vigour, and commences:</p>

<p class="blockquot"> "Unjust objections commonly proceed from unreasonable
   expectation; writers are often censured for omitting what they
   never intended to perform."</p>

<p>The note, p 48:</p>

<p class="blockquot"> "Though the design of these notes is rather to teach grammar than
   morality, yet, as I think nothing a deviation that can serve the
   cause of virtue," &amp;c.,</p>

<p>and the excellent remarks, p. 198., on Machiavel's <i>Life of Castruccio
Castracani</i>, have every internal evidence of Johnson's style, and were
no doubt dictated by him to Baretti, for whom Johnson in the same year,
1755, endeavours to obtain the loan of <i>Crescimbeni</i> from Thomas Warton
(Croker's <i>Boswell</i>, edit. 1848, p. 91.).</p>

<p>Nothing is more wanted than a good and complete edition of Johnson's
Works, in which omissions similar to the above, of which I have a long
list when required, may be supplied. His prefaces and dedications to the
works of other writers are all models in their way, and not one of them
ought to be lost.</p>

<h3>
<span>THE POET COLLINS.</span>
</h3>


<p>The deeply interesting additions lately made in your pages to our
knowledge of General Wolfe, induces me to hope, if not quite to expect,
that something, however small, may be done in the same joint-stock
manner for the memory of the poet Collins. Sir Egerton Brydges asserts
that "new facts regarding Collins are not to be had," and I am deeply
sensible of the value of Mr. Dyce's labours, as well as of those of the
editor of Mr. Pickering's Aldine edition of his works. No pains,
trouble, or expense, have been spared in collecting and arranging the
"dulces exuviæ" of the highly gifted poet; and the memoir prefixed to
Pickering's edition reflects no small credit upon the good taste and
feeling of the editor.</p>

<p>Still may I not ask, through the medium of the "N. &amp; Q.," whether some
further discoveries may not possibly be made? Cannot any one connected
with the town of Chichester, where Collins was born and died&mdash;any one
brought up at Winchester College, where he was educated, lend a helping
hand? Are there no additional traces of him as directly or indirectly
associated with the Wartons, Johnson, Quin, Garrick, Foote, and Thomson?
Cannot some of his letters be discovered? Some fragments of his poetry,
however disjointed? Some portions of his prose? There seems a mystery
about Collins himself, as strange as that about his own weird
compositions. Though beloved and admired by all, no one ever picked up
accurate information respecting him. He has been blamed for waywardness
and want of perseverance, as if these were not symptoms of the<a id="Page_103"></a>
 <span class="pagenum">[103]</span>
fearful visitation that wrecked his noble mind; or as if perseverance
and concentration of energies in any pursuit were not natural gifts as
much as acquired, and gifts of a high and most valuable kind too.
Collins did not want perseverance whilst at school: he came off first on
the roll of which Joseph Warton was second; and his <i>Oriental Eclogues</i>,
written before his eighteenth year, are not unworthy of the boyhood of
any of our greatest poets. Besides, he was a highly accomplished
classical scholar, an accurate linguist, was well read in early English
poetry and black-letter books, was passionately fond of music; and some
of his poems, if nothing else, prove him to have viewed nature with a
painter's eye. In his own line of poetry, the personification of
abstract qualities, Collins stands unrivalled. Let us but compare him
with all or any of his numerous imitators, and we ever find him in the
calm dignity of genius,</p>

<div class="poem">

     <p> "Sitting where they durst not soar."</p>

</div>

<p>Amidst such a number of book-learned correspondents as you have, surely
I may "lay the flattering unction to my soul" that some interesting
discoveries could be made.</p>

<p>Collins is well worthy of all that can be done for his memory, for if
his <i>Ode on the Passions</i> and his <i>Ode to Evening</i> be not true poetry, I
fear that the English language has not much poetry to produce.</p>

<h3>
<span>PORTRAITS OF HENRY PURCELL.</span>
</h3>

<p>Being employed upon an entirely new biography of <i>Henry Purcell</i>, I am
most anxious to procure all the information in my power relative to the
various portraits extant of this "famous musician." Granger's list is
very imperfect, but having by my own researches considerably extended
it, I submit it to your readers for perusal, in the hope that those who
are versed in the lore of "print" or "picture collecting" may correct
errors, or point out omissions.</p>

<p><i>Paintings and Drawings.</i></p>

<p>1. Head of Purcell, painted by Sir Godfrey Kneller. Lately in the
possession of E. Bates, Esq., of Somerset House.</p>

<p>2. Half-length, said (but evidently erroneously) to have been painted by
Sir Joshua Reynolds. Now in the meeting-room of the Royal Society of
Musicians, Lisle Street, Soho.</p>

<p>3. Half-length, originally used as a sign at the tavern known by the
name of "The Purcell's Head," in Wych Street, Strand. Query, where is it
at present?</p>

<p>4. Portrait of Purcell when a very young man, formerly among
Cartwright's pictures in Dulwich College. Query, what has become of it?</p>

<p>5. An original portrait by Closterman. In his hand is a miniature of
Queen Mary. Formerly in the collection of Charles Burney, Mus. Doc., at
whose sale it was sold, in 1814, for 18<i>l.</i> 18<i>s.</i> I cannot trace this
picture.</p>

<p>6. Crayon drawing, by Sir Godfrey Kneller, from the first-mentioned
painting. Formerly in Mr. Bartleman's collection.</p>

<p><i>Engravings.</i></p>

<p>1. An engraving by T. Cross, prefixed as frontispiece to his <i>Twelve
Sonatas</i>, 1683.</p>

<p>2. Ditto, by R. White, from a painting by Closterman. Frontispiece to
the <i>Orpheus Britannicus</i>.</p>

<p>3. Ditto, engraved by W. N. Gardiner, from a drawing by S. Harding,
taken from the original picture in Dulwich College, 1794.</p>

<p>4. Ditto, by T. Holloway, from the crayon drawing by Sir Godfrey
Kneller.</p>

<p>5. An etching inscribed "Henry Purcell," but without the name of painter
or engraver.</p>

<p>6. A small engraving, by Grignion, in Sir John Hawkins's <i>History of
Music</i>.</p>

<p>7. An engraving by W. Humphries, after Sir Godfrey Kneller. Frontispiece
to Novello's edit. of Purcell's <i>Sacred Music</i>.</p>

<h3>
<span>QUERY ON THE CONTROVERSY ABOUT FLUXIONS.</span>
</h3>

<p>In the report made by the Committee of the Royal Society, it is stated
that the Committee had "consulted the Letters and Letter-books in the
custody of the Royal Society, and those found among the Papers of Mr.
<i>John Collins</i>....;" thus leaving it doubtful whether Collins's papers
<i>then</i> belonged to the Society, or, it may be, meaning to distinguish
them as not so belonging.</p>

<p>In the preface to the <i>Analysis per Quantitatum Series</i> ... by William
Jones (father of his more celebrated namesake), London, 1711, 4to.,
which contains some of the matter published in 1712 in the <i>Commercium
Epistolicum</i>, occurs the following passage:&mdash;</p>

<p class="blockquot">"Etenim secundus jam agitur annus ex quo Scrinia <i>D. Collinsii</i>
   (qui, uti notum est, amplissimum cum sui sæculi Mathematicis
   commercium habuit) meas in manus inciderint; et in illis plurima
   reperi à cunctis fere totius <i>Europæ</i> eruditis ipsi communicata;
   et inter ea non pauca, quæ a Viro Cl. D. <i>Newtono</i> scripta
   fuerint."</p>

<p>This is hardly language which could be used with reference to papers
lodged in the custody of the Society: it would seem as if Jones, in 1709
or 1710, became the owner or borrower of papers, till then in private
hands exclusively. Can any evidence be brought forward as to the manner
in which Jones and the Royal Society, or either, obtained these papers?
I believe the Royal Society itself can give no information.</p>

<h4>
<span><i>Trumpington Church.</i></span>
</h4>

<p>&mdash;On the north side of the tower of Trumpington
Church, Cambridgeshire, there is a curious recess in the basement story,
which I have not met with anywhere else, or seen fully accounted for. It
is sufficiently capacious for a man to stand in, having an arched
entrance six feet in height, with a turning to the westward of about two
feet, and is formed completely within the thickness of the wall. The
village tradition, that it was formerly used as a confessional, founded
on the existence of an opening into the interior part of the tower, now
blocked up, has long been disesteemed. In the volume by the Cambridge
Camden Society, on the Churches in Cambridgeshire, it is said to have
been made for an ecclesiastic to stand in, to ring the Sanctus bell. A
round hole, lined with wood, in the roof of the niche, evidently
intended for a bell-rope, and chafings upon the upper part of the little
aperture, such as the friction of one would produce, are very convincive
of its having been used for <i>some such</i> purpose. But when we consider
that the Sanctus bell, except when a hand one, was "suspended on the
outside of the church, in a small turret over the archway leading from
the nave into the chancel,"<a id="cel5"></a><a title="Go to footnote 5." href="#fn5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> the probability that it was made for the
purpose above-mentioned seems very much weakened. I shall feel obliged
for a reference to any other instance, or a more satisfactory

<h4>
<span><i>The Garrote.</i></span>

<p>&mdash;The West India newspapers are filled with the details of
General Lopez's second attempt on Cuba, and his subsequent capture and
execution. The latter event took place at Havannah on the 1st September,
in presence of 8000 troops, and the manner of it is said to have been
the <i>Garrote</i>, which is thus described in a Jamaica Journal:&mdash;</p>

<p class="blockquot">"The prisoner is made to sit in a kind of chair with a high back,
   to which his head is fastened by means of an iron clasp, which
   encloses his neck, and is attached to the back by a screw. When
   the signal is given, the screw is turned several times, which
   strangles the victim, and breaks his neck."</p>

<p>The word <i>Garrote</i> being Spanish (derived probably from the French
"garrotter"), and the punishment having been inflicted in a Spanish
colony, it is to be presumed that we are indebted to the latter nation
for the invention of it. Can any of your readers give any information as
to the origin and use of this mode of punishment?</p>

compiling a perfect list from such works as the publications of the
Roxburgh, Bannatyne, and Maitland Clubs, Innes's <i>Origines Parochiales</i>,

different counties, or by the respective orders of the religious houses,
with a separate list of the <i>mitred houses</i> that had seats in
parliament. The list is wanted for publication. Perhaps the writer of
"Scottish Abbeys and Cathedrals" in the <i>Quarterly</i> may have compiled

<h4>
<span>"<i>A Roaring Meg.</i>"</span>
</h4>

<p>&mdash;What is the origin of calling any huge piece of

<p>Burton, in his <i>Anatomy of Melancholy</i>, says:</p>

<p class="blockquot"> "Musica est mentis medecina mæstæ, <i>a roaring meg</i> against
   melancholy, to rear and revive the languishing soul."</p>

<p>The earliest edition of the <i>Anatomy of Melancholy</i> is, I believe, the
Oxford one of 1624.<a id="one6"></a><a title="Go to footnote 6." href="#fn6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a></p>

<p class="footnote"><a id="fn6"></a><a title="Return to text." href="#one6" class="label">[6]</a> The first edition
 was published in 1621,
4to.&mdash;E<span class="smcap lowercase">D</span>.</p>

<p>The large old-fashioned piece of artillery, called <i>Mons Meg</i>, in the
castle of Edinburgh, which is so great a favourite with the Scottish
common people, is said by Sir Walter Scott to have been "fabricated at
Mons in Flanders, in the reign of James IV. or V. of Scotland;" that is,
between <span class="smcap lowercase">A.D</span>. 1508 and 1514 (note to <i>Rob Roy</i>, vol. ii. ch. 10.).</p>

<p>This accounts for the <i>Mons</i>; but whence comes the <i>Meg</i>? The tradition
of the Edinburgh people is different from that of Sir Walter: and Black,
in his <i>Tourist of Scotland</i>, pp. 51. 341., says, it was forged at
Threave Castle, a stronghold of the Black Douglases; was used by James
II. in 1455; and that it was called <i>Mons Meg</i> after "the man who cast
it and his wife." The date in the above must be a mistake, as I believe
James II. was killed in <span class="smcap lowercase">A.D.</span> 1437.</p>

<p>There is another cannon of similar caliber, and bearing the name of
<i>Roaring Meg</i>, presented by the Fishmongers' Company of London to the
city of Londonderry in 1642 (Simpson's <i>Annals of Derry</i>, chap. vii. p.
41.).</p>

<span class="bla">Minor Queries Answered.</span>
</h3>

<h4>
<span><i>Hornchurch; Wrestling for the Boar's Head.</i></span>
</h4>

<p>&mdash;I have extracted from the
<i>Daily News</i> of the 5th instant, the following paragraph, which appears
to have been quoted from the <i>Chelmsford Chronicle</i>, relative to this
custom:&mdash;</p>

<p class="blockquot"> "By ancient charter or usage in Hornchurch, a boar's head is
   wrestled for in a field adjoining the church; a boar, the
   property of the parish, having been slaughtered for the purpose.
   The boar's head, elevated on a pole, and decorated with ribbons,
   was brought into the ring, where the competitors entered and the
   prize awarded."</p>

<p>The paragraph goes on further to observe that if the prize be taken by
<i>a champion</i> out of the parish, the charter is lost. And I shall be glad
to know the origin of the custom, and of the notion of the charter or
usage, as it is called, being lost if the prize be taken away as before
alluded to. I observe that it is noticed in the <i>Gentleman's Magazine</i>
for April, 1828, p. 305.</p>

<p class="blockquot"> [It may be as well to state, as a clue to the discovery of this
   ancient custom, that the tithes of Hornchurch belong to New
   College, Oxford; the warden and fellows of which society are
   ordinaries of the place, and appoint a commissary, who holds an
   annual visitation. The lessee of the tithes supplies the boar's
   head, dressed and garnished with bay leaves, &amp;c. Several curious
   notices are given by Hone in his works of the custom observed at
   Christmas at Queen's College, Oxford, of serving up at the first
   course at dinner, "a fair and large boreshead upon a silver
   platter with minstralsye;" but he has omitted to furnish the
   origin of the custom at Hornchurch. Perhaps some Oxonian
   connected with New College will favour us with a reply.]</p>



<h4>
<span><i>Spectacles.</i></span>
</h4>

<p>&mdash;In recent numbers of "N. &amp; Q." there have been several
allusions to spectacles, and as I am not aware of any clear and
satisfactory data relative to the origin or antiquity of this most
important auxiliary to the extension and usefulness of that sense upon
which the enjoyment and value of life so much depends, I beg to submit
the Query, What is the earliest form in which evidence of the existence
of this invaluable optical aid to the human eye presents itself?</p>

 <p class="right">       H.</p>

<p class="blockquot"> [Dr. Johnson expressed his surprise that the inventor of
   spectacles was regarded with indifference, and has found no
   biographer to celebrate his deeds. Most authorities give the
   latter part of the thirteenth century as the period of their
   invention, and popular opinion has pronounced in favour of
   Alexander de Spina, a native of Pisa, who died in the year 1313.
   In the Italian Dictionary, <i>Della Crusca</i>, under the head of
   "Occhiale," or Spectacles, it is stated that Friar Jordan de
   Rivalto tells his audience, in a sermon published in 1305, that
   "it is not twenty years since the art of making spectacles was
   found out, and is indeed one of the best and most necessary
   inventions in the world." This would place the invention in the
   year 1285. On the other hand, Dominic Maria Manni, an eminent
   Italian writer, attributes the invention to Salvino Armati, who
   flourished about 1345. (See his Treatise, <i>Degli Occhiali da
   Naso, inventati da Salvino Armati</i>, 4to. 1738.) On the authority
   of various passages in the writings of Friar Bacon, Mr. Molyneux
   is of opinion that he was acquainted with the use of spectacles;
   and when Bacon (<i>Opus Majus</i>) says, that "this instrument (a
   plano-convex glass, or large segment of a sphere) is useful to
   old men, and to those who have weak eyes; for they may see the
   smallest letters sufficiently magnified," we may conclude that
   the particular way of assisting decayed sight was known to him.
   It is quite certain that they were known and used about the time
   of his death, <span class="smcap lowercase">A.D</span>. 1292.]</p>

<h3>
<span>MEANING AND ORIGIN OF ERA.<br />
(Vol. iv., pp. 383. 454.)</span>
</h3>

<p>It would greatly assist the elucidation of this word, if the earliest
instances extant of its use, in a chronological sense, could be
ascertained.</p>

<p>The dictionary of Facciolatus goes no further<a id="Page_107"></a>
 <span class="pagenum">[107]</span> back than Isidorus
the younger, at the end of the sixth century; who perhaps was the first
who gave to era the meaning of a cursus of years: before his time, as
well as afterwards, it is certain that era was a synonyme of annus.</p>

<p>In recording dates, the Spanish account made no use of <i>annus</i> either
expressed or understood&mdash;<i>era</i> was an independent word, having numerals
in concord with itself: thus it was prima era, secunda era, tertia era,
&amp;c. Spelman therefore had sufficient reason to contend that the origin
of <i>era</i> might be Gothic and not Roman, and that it is but a variation
of our own word <i>year</i>. He says that Isidorus, when dating from the
Roman epoch, used the Roman word, but that when dating from the Gothic
epoch, he conformed to the idiom of the Goths, "apud quos," he adds,
"eram annum significasse ex eo liqueat, quod prisci Saxones (quibus
magna Gothis sermonis affinitas) annum '&#540;ear' dicebant&mdash;Angli hodie
'year'&mdash;Belgi 'iaer.'"</p>

<p>The absence of the diphthong in era is attributed by Facciolatus to the
barbarism of the age; but it is at least equally probable that the
diphthong never did really belong to era, but that its claim to it
originated in the fanciful derivation from æs, as imagined by
Isidorus&mdash;or rather from es, as he would spell it, the real corruption
being in the latter word: thus, when the diphthong was restored to æs,
it would, as a matter of course, be also applied to its supposed
affinitive.</p>

<p>The Spaniards, who have the best right to the word, have never adopted
the diphthong. With them it is still era, and Scaliger asserts that
there is not in all Spain a single inscription in which the diphthong is
recognised. Alluding to Sepulveda, he says,&mdash;</p>

<p class="blockquot">"Mirum mihi visum hominem doctissimum ac præterea Hispanum, cum
   tot monimenta extent in Hispania in quibus hujus rei memoria
   sculpta est, ne unum vidisse&mdash;In illis, ut diximus, nunquam æra,
   semper era, scriptum est."</p>

<p>The practical institution of the Spanish, or era account, was probably,
like the Dionysian, long subsequent to its nominal commencement; so that
an enquiry into its earliest known record would possess the additional
interest of determining whether such were the case or not.</p>

<p>Censorinus, in his comparative enumeration of the various accounts of
years&mdash;the Julian&mdash;the Augustan&mdash;the Olympiad&mdash;and the Palilian, makes
no mention of the Era, which he would scarcely have omitted, had it been
then in existence and of imperial institution. Between his time,
therefore, which was towards the middle of the third century, and that
of Isidorus, the practice of computation by eras most probably arose.</p>

<p>As for its institution by Cæsar Augustus, which rests on the authority
of Isidorus; that suggestion, even if free from anachronism, had
probably no better foundation than an accidental similitude in sound,
and a wish to compliment the bishop of C<span class="smcap lowercase">ÆSARAUGUSTA</span>, to whom the epistle
containing it was addressed by him of Hispalis. The latter appears to
have dealt largely in conjecture in framing his Origines&mdash;as, for
example, in hora,&mdash;</p>

<p class="blockquot">"Hora enim finis est temporis sic et oræ, sunt fines maris,
   fluminorum, et  vestimentorum"&mdash;</p>

<p>an analogy which reminds one of the cockney&mdash;hedge from edge, because it
<i>edges</i> the field.</p>

<p>With respect to the initial-letter method of derivation, of which, in
the case of era, there are three or four different versions, something
has been already said upon that subject, with reference to the alleged
derivation of N. E. W. S. in the first volume of "N. &amp; Q." Scaliger
called such suggestions puerile and ridiculous, and doubtless they are
little better; his castigation of Sepulveda's version was so complete
that it may well serve for its modern imitations.</p>

<p>The original meaning of era has been, like our own word <i>day</i>, expanded
into a period of indefinite duration; in that sense it is particularly
useful as a general denomination for a running account of years. It is
an elegant and convenient expression, and its service to chronological
and historical language could be ill dispensed with&mdash;it has, moreover,
the prescription of long usage in its favour.</p>

<p>But a modern and far more indefensible attempt has been made in the
opposite extreme, to deprive era of all duration, and to restrict its
meaning to that of a mere initial point&mdash;such a meaning, already well
supplied by the word epoch, is, in the case of era, opposed alike to
reason, analogy, usefulness, and usage.</p>

<span>SINGING OF SWANS.<br />

<p>Amongst the Egyptians, the <span class="smcap lowercase">SWAN</span> was an emblem of music and musicians:
<i>Cygnus</i> with the Latins was a common synonym for <i>poeta</i>, and we
sometimes use the expression ourselves; thus, Shakspeare is called "the

<p>This bird was sacred to Apollo, as being endued with
<span class="smcap lowercase">DIVINATION</span>,
"<i>because, foreseeing his happiness in death, he dies with singing and
pleasure</i>:"</p>

<p class="blockquot">"Cygoni non sine causa Apolini dicati sint, quod ab eo

<p>Tennyson, with all that luxury of dreariness, sadness, and weariness,

I subjoin an extract, wishing your limits would admit of the entire:</p>

<div class="poem">

      <p>"The plain was grassy, wild and bare,</p>
      <p>Wide, wild, and open to the air,</p>

     <p> With an inner voice the river ran,</p>
      <p>Adown it floated a dying swan,</p>
         <p> Which loudly did lament.</p>
        <p>It was the middle of the day.</p>
       <p> Ever the weary wind went on,</p>

<hr class="small" />

     <div class="poem">

      <p>With a music strange and manifold</p>
     <p> Flow'd forth on a carol free and bold."</p>

</div>

<p>So much for the melody of the <i>dying</i> swan. That of the <i>living</i> swan
also requires consideration. Mr. Nicol, in his valuable <i>Iceland,
Greenland, &amp;c.</i>, thus describes the <i>Cygnus musicus</i> which frequents the
lakes and rivers of Iceland:</p>

<p class="blockquot"> "The largest and noblest of this class [the natatorial] is
   undoubtedly <span class="smcap lowercase">THE WILD OR WHISTLING SWAN</span>, with pure white plumage,
   slightly tinged on the head with orange-yellow. This majestic
   bird is five feet long, and, with extended wings, eight broad. It
   is rarely seen in Greenland, and appears merely to rest in Faroe,
   on its journeys to and from Iceland in the spring and autumn.
   Some of them, however, remain all the winter in the latter,
<span class="smcap lowercase"> AND DURING THE LONG DARK NIGHTS THEIR WILD SONG IS OFTEN HEARD</span> as
   they are passing in troops from one place to another. It appears
   to be a kind of signal or watchword to prevent the dispersion of

 <span class="smcap lowercase">RESEMBLING

   occurring after a distinct interval.
<span class="smcap lowercase">THIS MUSIC IS SAID TO
   PRESAGE A THAW</span>, and hence the Icelanders are well pleased when,
   in long-continued frosts, it breaks their repose."</p>

<p>He adds in a note, "The account of the
 <span class="smcap lowercase">MIDNIGHT SONG OF THE SWAN</span> is from
Olafsen, who says it 'das allerangenehmste zu hören ist,' is very
delightful to hear."</p>

<p>Henderson says of the river Nordura in Iceland, near its confluence with
the Hrita:</p>

<p class="blockquot">"The bleakness of the surrounding rocks was greatly enlivened by
   the number of <span class="smcap lowercase">SWANS</span> that were swimming

<p>In the Edda we find Njörd, god of the winds and waves, when he came back
to the mountains to please his wife, thus singing:</p>

   nothing but the howling of wolves, instead of the

<h3>
<span>QUEEN BRUNEHILDA. <br />
(Vol. v., p. 40.)</span>
</h3>

<p class="center topnum"><a id="lda8"></a><a title="Go to footnote 8." href="#fn8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a></p>

<p>I am glad that C. B. has questioned the propriety of the epithet "female
monster," which some of your correspondents have applied to Queen
Brunehilda. Knowing how the passion and prejudice that characterise
party spirit have under our own observation been able to distort facts
and blacken characters, we should receive with the greater caution the
statements of those who, if they were free, which is hardly possible,
from a strong bias, lived in an age when exact information was hardly
possible to obtain, and when the most odious calumnies could defy
refutation. From the success with which Brunehilda maintained the
sovereignty of her husband's kingdom through a long life, I should
conclude that she was a woman of great abilities as well as energy; and
the terms in which Gregory the Great addresses her, tend to confirm this
opinion. And in reference to this it seems somewhat surprising that it
should not have struck those who first raised this question, that the
evidence of the "wise and virtuous pontiff" was at least as good as that
of the historian who might be neither wise nor virtuous. Gregory is
surely as powerful to raise Brunehilda, as Brunehilda to pull down
Gregory. But the plain fact is, that there is a<a id="Page_109"></a>
 <span class="pagenum">[109]</span> tendency to be
hyperbolical in our estimation of crowned heads; in all probability, if
one was no monster the other was no saint.</p>

<p>The circumstances in favour of the more favourable view of Brunehilda's
character, are sufficiently well attested. That she was the superior in
every respect to Fredegunda probably she felt herself, and as probably
the latter was made to feel. Gregory of Tours was not merely struck by
the beauty of her person and her engaging manner, but he has also
remarked upon her good sense and her agreeable conversation. Sisterly
affection appears in the first instance to have precipitated her into a
conflict that ended but with her life. Her sister's murder was followed
by those of Sigebert and Merowig; and it is not a little remarkable that
though it is not doubted who was the instigator of these crimes, the
name of "monster" is never applied to Fredegunda, but reserved for the
familiar appellation of her victim. When we consider how generally vague
are the charges against Brunehilda, and, regarding what is otherwise
known of her, how improbable, I think some suspicion of an undue leaning
on the part of the Frankish historians will not be altogether misplaced.
My own opinion is that she was one of those remarkable women who from
time to time astonish the world; one, whom for her superior knowledge
and acquirements, the rumour of a rude age gifted with supernatural
powers. And I am farther inclined to think that in the course of time
the characters reported of her from opposite sources became finally so
antagonistic, that they came to be considered as those of two distinct
persons; and with a reference to the eternal enmity between Fredegunda
and herself, she became more world-wide famous than has been hitherto
supposed, as both the Criemhilda and Brunehilda of the <i>Nibelungen
Noth</i>. Many circumstances may be brought forward to support this latter
view.</p>

<h3>
<span>COVERDALE'S BIBLE.<br />
(Vol. v., p. 59.)</span>
</h3>

<p>The answer of our friend M<span class="smcap lowercase">R</span>. O<span class="smcap lowercase">FFOR</span> to the inquiry of your correspondent
H. H. H. V., Vol. v., p. 59., would have required no remarks but for the
paragraph which follows his description of the copies of Coverdale's
Bible in his valuable collection. That paragraph was as follows:&mdash;</p>

<p class="blockquot"> "The introduction of the words <i>from the Douche and Latyn</i> has
   never been accounted for; they probably were inserted by the
   German printer to make the volume more popular, so as to interest
   reformers by the German of Luther, and Romanists by the Vulgate
   Latin. The translation is certainly from the Hebrew and Greek,
   compared with Luther's and the Vulgate."</p>

<p>If M<span class="smcap lowercase">R</span>. O<span class="smcap lowercase">FFOR</span> will look at "the Prologue to the Translation of the
Bible&mdash;Myles Coverdale unto the Christian Reader," in that copy of his,
which he describes with the delight of an amateur of rare editions as
having "several uncut leaves," he may read in its first page, how
Coverdale confesses, with that humility which especially adorned his
character, that "his insufficiency in the tongues" made him loath to
undertake the task. He then touchingly alludes to Tyndale's adversity,
suppressing his name, while he speaks of his "ripe knowledge," and
laments the hindrances to his completing the translation of the
Scriptures. But "to help me herein," he proceeds, "I have had sundry
translations, not only in Latin, but also of the Dutch [<i>i.e.</i> German]
interpreters, whom because of their singular gifts and special diligence
in the Bible, I have been the more glad to follow for the most part,
according as I was required." And again he says, "Lowly and faithfully
have I followed mine interpreters."</p>

<p>My attention was drawn to this subject nearly thirty years ago by the
strange inaccuracies in Bishop Marsh's account of the sources of our
authorised version; in which he had assumed that Tyndale could not
translate from the Hebrew, which there is the clearest evidence that he
knew well; and that he therefore translated from the German, of which
language it is almost equally certain that he was ignorant.</p>

<p>I saw, on the other hand, that Coverdale honestly confessed that his own
translation was a secondary one, from the German and the Vulgate. He
named the language, but not the translator, Luther, for the same reason
that in two references to Tyndale's ability he desisted from naming him,
viz., that his translation was to be dedicated to Henry VIII., who hated
both their names.</p>

<p>To test the different sources from which Tyndale and Coverdale formed
their respective translations, nothing more is necessary than to open
any chapter in the Hebrew and German Bibles; and whilst the translators
from either will of course be found to agree in the broad meaning of any
verse, there will be delicate distinctions in rendering idiomatic forms
of speech, which will be decisive of the question. Having preserved my
collation of some verses in Genesis xli., I find the following:</p>

<p>Ver. 1. First word,
<span title="[Hebrew: vayhîy]">&#1493;&#1463;&#1497;&#1456;&#1492;&#1460;&#1497; </span>, literally, <i>And it was</i>. An introductory
expression fairly represented by the Greek <span title="[Greek: Egeneto de]">&#917;&#947;&#949;&#957;&#949;&#964;&#959; &#948;&#949;</span>. Tyndale,
<i>And it fortuned</i>. Luther and the Vulgate have omitted it, and therefore
so has Coverdale.</p>

<p>
<span title="[Hebrew: vhinnêh]">&#1493;&#1456;&#1492;&#1460;&#1504;&#1468;&#1461;&#1492;</span>, lit. <i>And
 behold</i>; Luther, <span class="bla1">Wie</span>; Coverdale, <i>How that</i>.</p>

<p>
<span title="[Hebrew: 'alhay'ôr]">&#1506;&#1500;-&#1492;&#1497;&#1488;&#1512;</span>, LXX, <span title="[Greek: Epi tou potamou]">&#917;&#960;&#953; &#964;&#959;&#965;
 &#960;&#959;&#964;&#945;&#956;&#959;&#965;</span>; Tyndale, <i>By a river's side</i>;
Luther, <span class="bla1">Am Wasser</span>; Coverdale, <i>By a water side</i>. Here the Greek
preserves the emphatic article <span title="[Hebrew: h]">&#1492;</span>, which pointed to the Nile;
the Latin necessarily<a id="Page_110"></a>
 <span class="pagenum">[110]</span> lose it, Tyndale neglects it, Coverdale
copies Luther's vague expression. Our authorised version has correctly,
<i>By the river</i>.</p>

<p>Ver. 2.
<span title="[Hebrew: minhay'ôr 'ôlôth]">&#1502;&#1503;-&#1492;&#1497;&#1488;&#1512; &#1506;&#1500;&#1514;</span>, literally, <i>Out of the river ascending</i>; LXX,
<span title="[Greek: Ek tou potamou anebainon]">&#917;&#954; &#964;&#959;&#965; &#960;&#959;&#964;&#945;&#956;&#959;&#965; &#945;&#957;&#949;&#946;&#945;&#953;&#957;&#959;&#957;</span>;
 Vulg., <i>De quo ascendebant</i>; Luther, <span class="bla1">Aus dem Wasser steigen</span>;
 Coverdale, <i>Out of the water there came</i>; Tyndale,
<i>There came out of the river</i>.</p>

<p>Ver. 3.
<span title="[Hebrew: vatta'amôdenâh]">&#1493;&#1463;&#1514;&#1468;&#1463;&#1506;&#1458;&#1502;&#1465;&#1491;&#1456;&#1504;&#1464;&#1492;  </span>, Tyndale, <i>And stode</i>, which is quite literal; Vulg.,
<i>Et pascebantur</i>; Luther, <span class="bla1">Und traten</span>; Coverdale, <i>And went</i>.</p>

<p>Ver. 7.
<span title="[Hebrew: vehinnêh chalôwm]">&#1493;&#1456;&#1492;&#1460;&#1504;&#1468;&#1461;&#1492; &#1495;&#1458;&#1500;&#1493;&#1465;&#1501;  </span>, lit. <i>And behold a dream</i>; Vulg., <i>Post quietem</i>;
Tyndale, <i>And see, here is his dream</i>; Luther, <span class="bla1">Und merckte daß es ein Traum war</span>;
 Coverdale, <i>And saw that it was a dream</i>.</p>

<p>Such instances might be multiplied to any extent. Their effect upon my
mind was to convince me that Coverdale did not even know the Hebrew
letters when he published his version of the Bible. In fact, the Jews
being then expelled from England, and the only Hebrew Lexicon, that of
Xantes Pagninus, having probably not arrived here, it was scarcely
possible for an Englishman to master the Hebrew tongue, without going
abroad to obtain access to learned Jews, as Tyndale did, and as
Coverdale himself did after the appearance of his Bible; and then, as I
think Mr. Pearson has afforded some evidence, he may have become
acquainted with Hebrew.</p>

<p>If H. H. H. V. desires to know more of Coverdale, he can find all that
late researches have been able to discover in the first volume of Mr C.
Anderson's <i>Annals of the English Bible</i>, and in the biographical notice
of Coverdale prefixed to the Parker Society's edition of his <i>Remains</i>,
by the Rev. G. Pearson. But when that gentleman describes Coverdale's
portion of Matthew's Bible, and says that the book of Jonah is of
Tyndale's version, he has made a mistake. Perhaps I may be allowed to
say, that the question, whether Tyndale put forth any version of Jonah,
is <i>adhuc sub judice</i>. At any rate, I can say, from collation, that the
Jonah in Matthew's Bible is identical with that which Coverdale put
forth in his own version.</p>

<p>The account of our early versions in Macknight's <i>Introduction to the
Epistles</i> is very erroneous; and that prefixed to D'Oyley and Mant's
Bible, published by the Christian Knowledge Society, is far from being
correct.</p>

<h3>
<span>SERJEANTS' RINGS AND MOTTOES.<br />
(Vol. v., pp. 59. 92.)</span>
</h3>

<p>For much curious information upon these subjects, I would refer your
correspondents to a rather scarce and privately printed tract or volume,
entitled <i>Observations touching the Antiquity and Dignity of
Serjeant-at-Law</i>, 1765. I am not sure that it was not subsequently
reprinted and published. The author was Mr. Serjeant Wynne. He says:</p>

<p class="blockquot">"The first introduction of rings themselves on this occasion (of
   making serjeants) is as doubtful as that of mottoes. They are
   taken notice of by Fortescue in the time of Hen. VI., and in the
   several regulations for general calls in Hen. VIII. and Queen
   Elizabeth's time. The antiquity of them, therefore, though not to
   be strictly ascertained, yet being thus far indisputable, makes
   Sir H. Spelman's account rather extraordinary (see <i>Gloss.</i> tit.
   <i>Serv. ad Legem</i>); but whatever is the antiquity of these rings,
   that of mottoes seems to fall short of them at least a century.
   That in the 19 &amp; 20 Eliz. (1576-77) may perhaps be the first;
   because, till that time, they are nowhere mentioned.</p>

<p class="blockquot">"When Dugdale speaks (p. 136.) of the posies 'that were usual,'
   he must be understood to speak of the usage of his own time."</p>


<p>The motto which Serj. Wynne notices as of the earliest occurrence in 19
&amp; 20 Eliz., was <i>Lex regis præsidium</i>. The earliest of subsequent date
appear to be as follow:</p>

<p>13 Car. II. <i>Adest Carolus Magnus.</i></p>

<p>2 Jac. II. <i>Deus, rex, lex</i>, (at the call of Christopher Milton, the
poet's brother, John Powell, and others).</p>

<p>3 Jac. II. <i>Rege lege.</i></p>

<p>1 Wm. &amp; Mary. <i>Veniendo restituit rem.</i></p>

<p>12 Wm. <i>Imperium et libertas.</i></p>

<p>2 Anne. <i>Deo et regina.</i></p>

<p>5 Anne. <i>Moribus, armis, legibus.</i></p>

<p>9 Anne. <i>Unit et imperat.</i></p>

<p>Serjeant Wynne brings his list of the Serjeants called down to the year
1765, and gives in most cases the mottoes, which were not confined, it
would seem, to individuals, but adopted by the whole call. He remarks,
that in late years they have been strictly classical in their phrase and
often elegant in their application,&mdash;whether in expressing the just idea
of regal liberty&mdash;in a wish for the preservation of the family&mdash;or in a
happy allusion to some public event, and, at the same time, a kind of
prophetic declaration of its success. At p. 117. will be found an
account of the expense and weight of the rings, which, upon the occasion
referred to, were 1,409 in number, and the expense 773<i>l.</i> I will not
occupy further space, but refer your correspondents to the work of
Serjeant Wynne.</p>

<p>The custom of Serjeants-at-law presenting rings on their creation was
used in (and probably before) the reign of Henry VI. (See <i>Fortescue De
Laudibus Legum Angliæ</i>, cap. 50,; and see instances and particulars in
the reigns at Henry VIII., Edward VI., Philip and Mary, and Elizabeth in
Dugdale's <i>Origines Juridiciales</i>, 2nd<a id="Page_111"></a>
 <span class="pagenum">[111]</span> edit., pp. 116. 118. 122.
123. 124. 130.) Mottoes were used as early as 1606, but I am not
prepared to say they originated at that period, though I do not observe
any mention of them in Dugdale's accounts of the ceremonies at the
creation of Serjeants of an earlier date. The following mottoes may
interest some of your readers:</p>

<p>Sir Edward Coke, 1606. <i>Lex est tutissima cassis.</i></p>

<p>Sir John Walter and Sir Thomas Trevor, 1625. <i>Regi legi servire
libertas.</i></p>

<p>Sir Henry Yelverton, 1625. <i>Stat lege corona.</i></p>

<p>Sir Robert Berkeley, 1627. <i>Lege Deus et rex.</i></p>

<p>Robert Callis, 1627. <i>Regis oracula legis.</i></p>

<p>Sir George Vernon, 1627. <i>Rex legis regnique patronus.</i></p>

<p>Sir James Weston, 1631. <i>Servus regi serviens legi.</i></p>

<p>Sir Robert Heath, 1631. <i>Lex regis vis regis.</i></p>

<p>Sir George Jeffreys, 1680. <i>A Deo rex a rege lex.</i></p>

<p>Sir Michael Foster, 1736. <i>Nunquam libertas gratior.</i></p>

<p>Sir William Blackstone, 1770. <i>Secundis dubiisque rectus.</i></p>

<p>Sir Alexander Thomson, 1787. <i>Reverentia legum.</i></p>

<p>William Cockell, 1787. <i>Stat lege corona.</i></p>

<p>On Serjeant Cockell's call, "in consequence of a late regulation no
rings were given to the judges, the bar, or to the attornies."</p>

<p>Some of the older, and most of the modern, law reporters, mention the
mottoes on the rings given by the serjeants.</p>

<p>T. P. is informed that the custom of Serjeants-at-law presenting rings
with mottoes prevailed long before <span class="smcap lowercase">A.D</span>. 1670. In the <i>Journal of the
Arch. Institute</i>, vol. vii. p. 196., he will find mention of a mediæval
ring of the kind, described as "A Serjeant-at-law's gold ring, the hoop
3/8 of an inch in width, and of equal thickness, inscribed <i>Lex regis
præsidium</i>."</p>

<p>On June 8, 1705, fifteen Serjeants-at-law took the customary oaths at
the Chancery Bar, and delivered to the Lord Keeper a ring for the Queen,
and another for his H.R.H. Prince George of Denmark, each ring being
worth 6<i>l.</i> 13<i>s.</i> 4<i>d.</i> The Lord Keeper, Lord Treasurer, Lord Steward,
Lord Privy Seal, Lord High Chamberlain, Master of the Household, Lord
Chamberlain, and the two Chief Justices, received each a ring of the
value of 18<i>s.</i>; the Lord Chief Baron, Master of the Rolls, the Justices
of either Bench and two Chief Secretaries each one worth 16<i>s.</i>; the
Chief Steward and Comptroller each a ring valued at 1<i>l.</i>; the Marshal,
Warden of the Fleet, every Serjeant-at-Law, the Attorney-General, and
Solicitor-General, each a ring worth 12<i>s.</i>; the three Barons of
Exchequer a ring worth 10<i>s.</i>; the two Clerks of the Crown, the three
Prothonotaries, the Clerks of the Warrants, the Prothonotary of Queen's
Bench, and the Chirographer, each a ring worth 5<i>s.</i>; each Filazer and
Exigenter, the Clerk of the Council, and the Custos Brevium, each a ring
that cost 2<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i> The motto on the rings was this, "<i>Moribus, armis,

<h3>
<span>EXTERMINATION OF EARLY CHRISTIANS IN ORKNEY.<br />
(Vol. iv., p. 439.)</span>
</h3>

<p>It is capable of demonstration that Christianity was introduced into the
Orkney Islands, or at least that missionaries were sent there, long
previous to the invasion of Harold Harfagre. Your correspondent W. H. F.
mentions that Depping, in the <i>Histoire des Expéditions Maritimes des
Normands</i>, states that Sigurd, the second nominally, though really the
first earl, expelled the Christians from Orkney, and he requests to know
Depping's authority; as the circumstance is not alluded to by Torfæus,
the Orkneyinga-Saga or Snorro Sturleson, and has been "either overlooked
by Barry, or unknown to him."</p>

<p>The well-known "Diploma or Genealogical Deduction of the Earls of
Orkney," written by the bishop of that diocese in the year 1406, and
printed in Wallace's <i>Account of Orkney</i>, and in the appendices to
Barry's <i>History</i>, and the Orkneyinga-Saga, is generally looked upon,
from the circumstances under which it was drawn up, as an authentic
document of considerable historical value. It is there mentioned, that
the Norsemen found the islands inhabited by the Peti and the Papé, whom
they exterminated. But I transcribe the words of the Diploma:</p>

<p class="blockquot">"Hæc terra sive insularum patria Orcadie fuit inhabitata et
   culta, duabus nacionibus scilicet Peti et Pape, que due genera
   naciones fuerant destructe radicitus, ac penitus per Norwegenses
   de stirpe sive de tribu strenuissimi principis Rognaldi, qui sic
   sunt ipsias naciones aggressi, quod posteritas ipsarum nacionum
   Peti et Pape non remansit."</p>

<p>Though Chalmers (<i>Caledonia</i>, vol. i. p. 261.) is rather inclined to
discredit the above account, it seems probable that those Papé were
missionaries or priests, who were also found, under precisely the same
name, in Iceland when that island was colonised by the Norsemen
(Pinkerton's <i>Enquiry</i>, vol. ii. p. 297.). I have not my copy of Depping
at present by me, and therefore am unable to say whether he explains his
use of the word <i>Christians</i> in his mention of their expulsion. It may
be that, without going into detail, he accepted, as proved, the identity
of the Papé and the priests, and believed himself warranted in making
the assertion. But perhaps he might have had some other<a id="Page_112"></a>
 <span class="pagenum">[112]</span> authority
of which I am ignorant, as he attributes the expulsion (according to W.
H. F.) to Sigurd, whereas the words of the Diploma are, "per Norwegenses
de stirpe sive de tribu strenuissimi principis Rognaldi," by no means
limiting the deed to his (Rognald's) immediate successor, though
inferentially accusing Sigurd of participation. A careful consideration
of the entire passage in Depping, and of his general style, may tend to
show whether he relied merely on the Diploma, or whether he had some
more definite authority.</p>

<p>I may mention, that though it has escaped W. H. F.'s observation, he
will find, by referring to pp. 87. 116. 133., Headrick's edition, that
Barry did not overlook the early Christianising of the Orkneys, and the
extirpation of the Papé; although, seeing that the former is matter of
history, and the latter was not a mere tradition in 1406, but derived
from a more trustworthy source ("sicut <i>cronice</i> nostre clare
demonstrant"), he is scarcely distinct enough, or decided in his
inferences. It would be interesting to know what were those "cronice"
appealed to by the bishop.</p>

<h3>
<span>
THE CRIME OF POISONING PUNISHED BY BOILING.<br />
(Vol. v., p. 32.)
</span>
</h3>

<p>M<span class="smcap lowercase">R</span>. J. B. C<span class="smcap lowercase">OLMAN</span> has directed attention to the special act of attainder
passed in 22 Hen. VIII. in order to punish Richard Roose for poisoning
the family of the Bishop of Rochester; but I have reason to believe that
he is wrong in his assertion that, prior to that statute, "there was no
peculiarity in the mode of punishment" for the crime in question. In the
<i>Chronicle of the Grey Friars of London</i>, which I am now engaged in
editing for the Camden Society, I find an instance of the like
punishment being inflicted for the same crime in the 13th Hen. VIII.:</p>

<p class="blockquot"> "And this yere was a man soddyne in a cautherne (<i>sc.</i> a
   cauldron) in Smythfelde, and lett up and downe dyvers tymes tyll
   he was dede, for because he wold a poyssynd dyvers persons."</p>

<p>I would therefore beg to inquire whether M<span class="smcap lowercase">R.</span> C<span class="smcap lowercase">OLMAN</span> has taken a correct
view of the statute of 22 Hen. VIII. as prescribing a new punishment,
<i>retrospective</i> to the case of Richard Roose; and whether the act was
not, so far as he was concerned, simply one of attainder, to deprive the
culprit of the "advantage of his clargie," whereby he might otherwise
have escaped the legal punishment already provided for the crime. Having
declared Roose attainted of high treason, the statute proceeds to enact
that all future poisoners shall also be debarred of the benefit of
clergy, and immediately committed to death by boiling. Roose's own case
is recorded in the <i>Grey Friars' Chronicle</i> with the same horrible
circumstances as those related in the former instance, of his life being
gradually destroyed:</p>

<p class="blockquot">"He was lockyd in a chayne and pullyd up and downe with a gybbyt
   at dyvers tymes tyll he was dede."</p>

<p>A third instance occurs in 1542, when&mdash;</p>

<p class="blockquot"> "The x day of March was a mayde boyllyd in Smythfelde for
   poysynyng of dyvers persons."</p>

<p>This last is the same case which is cited by L. H. K. in your Vol. ii.,
p. 519. If my view of the statute of 22 Hen. VIII. be the right one, it
still remains to be ascertained when this barbarous punishment was first
adopted; and is it certain that it ceased with the reign of Hen. VIII.?</p>

<p class="right">   J<span class="smcap lowercase">OHN</span> G<span class="smcap lowercase">OUGH</span> N<span class="smcap lowercase">ICHOLS</span>.</p>


<p>There appears to have occurred in Scotland <i>one</i> instance at least of
this barbarous mode of executing justice. In his Notes to Leyden's
Ballad of <i>Lord Soulis</i> (in the <i>Minstrelsy of the Border</i>), Sir Walter
Scott says:&mdash;</p>

<p class="blockquot">"The tradition regarding the death of Lord Soulis, however
   singular, is not without a parallel in the real history of
   Scotland. The same extraordinary mode of cookery was actually
   practised (<i>horresco referens</i>) upon the body of a Sheriff of the
   Mearns. This person, whose name was Melville of Glenbervie, bore
   his faculties so harshly, that he became detested by the Barons
   of the country. Reiterated complaints of his conduct having been
   made to James I. (or, as others say, to the Duke of Albany), the
   monarch answered, in a moment of unguarded impatience, 'Sorrow
   gin the Sheriff were sodden, and supped in broo!' The complainers
   retired, perfectly satisfied. Shortly after, the Lairds of
   Arbuthnot, Mather, Laureston, and Pattaraw, decoyed Melville to
   the top of the hill of Garvock, above Lawrencekirk, under
   pretence of a grand hunting party. Upon this place (still called
   the <i>Sheriff's Pot</i>), the Barons had prepared a fire and a
   boiling cauldron, into which they plunged the unlucky Sheriff.
   After he was <i>sodden</i> (as the king termed it) for a sufficient
   time, the savages, that they might literally observe the royal
   mandate, concluded the scene of abomination by actually partaking
   of the hell-broth.</p>

<p class="blockquot">"The three Lairds were outlawed for this offence; and Barclay,
   one of their number, to screen himself from justice, erected the
   kaim (<i>i.e.</i> the camp, or fortress) of Mathers, which stands upon
   a rocky and almost inaccessible peninsula, overhanging the German
   Ocean. The Laird of Arbuthnot is said to have eluded the royal
   vengeance, by claiming the benefit of the law of clan Macduff. A
   pardon, or perhaps a deed of replegiation, founded upon that law,
   is said to be still extant upon the records of the Viscount of
   Arbuthnot.</p>

<p class="blockquot"> "The punishment of boiling," adds Sir Walter, "seems to have been
   in use among the English at a very late period, as appears from
   the following passage in Stowe's <i>Chronicle</i>:&mdash;'The 17th March
   (1524) Margaret Davy, a maid, was boiled at Smithfield for
   poisoning of three households that she had dwelled in.'"<a id="Page_113"></a>
 <span class="pagenum">[113]</span></p>

<p>According to tradition, however, the boiling, or <i>broiling</i> rather, of
the Wizard-Earl Soulis, was still more frightful:&mdash;</p>

<span class="bla">Replies to Minor Queries.</span>

<h4>
<span><i>List of English Sovereigns</i> </span>
<span>(Vol. v., p. 28.).</span>
</h4>

<p>&mdash;The principal reason
why the names of the Empress Matilda, King Henry junior, and Queen Jane
(Grey or Dudley), are not inserted in the lists of English sovereigns,
as J. J. S. suggests they should be, arises from the fact of the periods
of their supposed reigns being concurrent with those of other monarchs,
and our constitution recognising one only at a time. The name of Queen
Jane has, however, found a place in some recent lists; following that
given in Sir Harris Nicolas's <i>Chronology of History</i> (edit. 1833, p.
330.), where he states that her nominal reign extended from the 6th to
the 17th July, 1553. Appended to <i>The Chronicle of Queen Jane and Queen
Mary</i> (printed for the Camden Society), I have given a list of all the
public documents or state papers known to be extant which bear date in
the reign of Queen Jane, and the last is a letter of the Privy Council
to Lord Rich, dated the 19th July; this extends the period two days
longer than in the <i>Chronology of History</i>, and was certainly the last
public document that recognised Jane's authority. Only one <i>private</i>
document so dated has been discovered. It is a deed relating to the
parish of St. Dunstan's in Kent (dated 15th July), which was
communicated by Mr. Hunter to the <i>Retrospective Review</i>, N. S. vol. i.
p. 505. But an act of parliament of the 1st March, 1553-4, legalised all
documents that might be so dated from the 6th of July to the last day of
the same month (<i>Nicolas</i>, p. 316.). Among our historians, Heylin, in
his <i>History of the Reformation</i>, has apportioned a distinct division of
his narrative to "The Reign of Queen Jane."</p>

<p>&mdash;I cannot tell H. B. C. what is the
<i>editio princeps</i> of these hymns; but as he appears to know of no
edition anterior to 1749, I beg to observe that an edition of <i>Psalms
and Hymns</i> for the use of the Moravians was published by the Rev. John
Gambold, one of their bishops, at London, in 1738. It is in 12mo.
without the name of any printer. There is a copy of this book in the
archiepiscopal library at Lambeth. But as it is five-and-twenty years,
or more, since I saw it, I have no recollection of the particulars of
its contents.</p>

<p>In 1801 a Moravian Hymn-book was issued, which, being out of print, was
reprinted in 1809. I should suppose the book a great improvement upon
the old Moravian hymn-books. I have a copy of the edition of 1809: about
half the hymns are translations from the German, and the rest selected
from Watts, Wesley, Steel, Robinson, and others. The hymn "To you, ye
Jesus' wounds" is not in it. The book contains also their simple and

<h4>
<span><i>Age of Trees&mdash;"Essex Broad Oak"</i> </span>
<span>(Vol. v., pp. 10. 40.).</span>
</h4>

<p>&mdash;Was not the
"Essex Broad Oak" identical with the "Fairlop Oak?" The Fairlop Oak is
thus described in <i>Excursions through Essex</i> (Longman, 1818, vol. ii. p.
56.):</p>

<p class="blockquot">"In Hainault Forest, about one mile from Barkingside, stands an
   oak which has been known through many centuries by the name of
   Fairlop. For an account of this celebrated tree (which seems to
   have escaped the attention of the laborious Camden, and his
   indefatigable continuator, Mr. Gough) we are indebted<a id="Page_114"></a>
 <span class="pagenum">[114]</span> to
   the Rev. Mr. Gilpin. 'The tradition of this tree,' says this
   ingenious writer in his <i>Remarks on Forest Scenery and other
   Woodland Views</i>, 'traces it half way up the Christian æra. It is
   still a noble tree, though it has suffered greatly from the
   depredations of time. About a yard from the ground, where its
   rough fluted stem is 36 feet in circumference, it divides into
   eleven vast arms; yet not in the horizontal manner of an oak, but
   rather in that of a beach. Beneath its shade, which overspreads
   an area of 300 feet in circuit, an annual fair has long been held
   on the first Friday in July.' This celebrated tree was for some
   time fenced round with a close paling about five feet high.
   Almost all the extremities of its branches have been sawed off,
   and Mr. Forsyth's composition applied to them, to preserve then
   from decay; and the injury which the trunk of the tree had
   sustained from the lighting of fires have been repaired, as much
   as possible, with the same composition. On one of the branches a
   board was fixed, with this inscription, 'All good foresters are
   requested not to hurt this old tree, a plaister having been
   lately applied to its wounds.'"</p>

<p>If my recollection serves me correctly, a drawing and description of
this old tree is contained in one of Hone's publications,&mdash;I think his
<i>Table Book</i>.<a id="ook9"></a><a title="Go to footnote 9." href="#fn9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a></p>

<p class="footnote"><a id="fn9"></a><a title="Return to text." href="#ook9" class="label">[9]</a> [The drawing and
 description of this venerable oak is given
in the <i>Mirror</i>, vol. ii. p. 81., where it is stated that Mr. Forsyth's
precautions were insufficient to protect it from an injurious custom
practised by many of its thoughtless visitors, of making a fire within
the cavities to cook their provisions; for, in the month of June, 1805,
it was set on fire, and continued burning until the following day, by
which the trunk was considerably injured. The high winds of February,
1820, at last stretched its massy trunk and limbs on that turf which it
had for so many ages overshadowed with its verdant foliage. The wood of
which the pulpit and reading-desk of St. Pancras new church are composed
was a portion of the Fairlop Oak; and are looked upon as matters of
greater curiosity perhaps, on that account, than even the beautiful
grained and highly polished material and the splendid carvings.&mdash;E<span class="smcap lowercase">D</span>.]</p>

<p>Another large tree is mentioned in the same volume (p. 87.) as being
called "Doodle [Query, <i>dole</i> or <i>boundary</i>] Oke."</p>

<p>To conclude (if I have not already trespassed too much upon your space),
Is the Fairlop Oak still standing; and, if so, what is its present
condition?</p>

 <p class="left">   Eye.</p>


<p>Cypress trees on the continent of America grow to immense ages. By
counting the concentric rings observed in the wood, on sawing a trunk
across, it appears that 400 years is a common age. There is a gigantic
trunk near Santa Maria del Tula, in the province of Oaxaca, in Mexico,
whose circumference at the dilated base is no less than 200 feet. Of
this, taking 1·6 line as the average growth of a year, the age would be
3512 years. (Lyell's <i>Second Visit to United States</i>, vol. ii. pp. 254,
255. Prescott's <i>Peru</i>, vol. ii. p. 315. 4th edition.) Adanson, the
celebrated botanist, calculated the age of one of the famous Baobab
trees of Senegal to be 5150 years. (Marquis of Ormonde's <i>Sicily</i>, p.
76.) A tamarind tree in the Mahometan burial-ground at Putelam, in
Ceylon, is 39 feet in diameter, or upwards of 117 feet in circumference,
from which the age may be calculated on the above scale. (Sirr's
<i>Ceylon</i>, vol. i. p. 85.)</p>

<h4>
<span><i>Arrangement of Books</i> </span>
<span>(Vol. v., p. 49.).</span>
</h4>

<p>&mdash;Your correspondent L.'s
letter is very valuable. May I add a few contributions?</p>

<p>There is a mode of printing used in Cuvier's <i>Règne Animal</i>, which is
exceedingly useful for books of classification, that is, to print those
sentences which relate to the primary divisions in a larger type, and
full up to the side; the subdivisions to be printed short, as sums are
entered in an account book, and in a smaller type. I believe I had the
fortune to introduce a slight improvement in indexes. For instance, in
your index the subordinate items are arranged according to time, but
that gives a great deal of trouble. Under M<span class="smcap lowercase">R</span>. B<span class="smcap lowercase">REEN'S</span> name there are
fifteen items; they should be arranged alphabetically, like the
principal items, as is done in the same index in the case of notices of
books, unavoidably. But such subordinate items had better, in general,
have the word on which the alphabetical arrangement turns printed in
Italics to catch the eye, rather than invert the order of the words, as
<i>must</i> be done in the principal items.</p>

<p>In what books the old spelling should be retained is a matter of
individual question, upon which no rules can be laid down. Walpole
complained that the <i>Paston Letters</i> were printed with the old spelling,
and that, though a version is on the opposite page; but few persons will
agree with him in that. In such books we have a right to see the old
spelling in order to judge whether the version is right, as well as for
general information.</p>

<span><i>The Ring-finger</i> </span>
<span>(Vol. iv., pp. 150. 198. 261.).</span>
</h4>

<p>&mdash;The two questions
mooted concerning the ring-finger, <i>i.e.</i> why the third finger is the
ring-finger, and why the wedding-ring is worn on the third finger of the
left hand? have not yet been satisfactorily answered.</p>

<p>The <i>third finger is the only recognised ring-finger</i>. Hence all who
wear rings <i>ex officio</i>, wear them on that finger. Cardinals, bishops,
doctors, abbots, &amp;c., wear their ring on the third finger. The <i>reason
is that it is the first vacant finger</i>. The thumb and the first two
fingers have always been reserved as symbols of the three persons of the
Blessed Trinity. When a bishop gives his blessing,<a id="Page_115"></a>
 <span class="pagenum">[115]</span> he blesses
with the thumb and first two fingers. Our brasses and sepulchral slabs
bear witness to this fact. And at the marriage ceremony, the ring is put
on to the thumb and the first two fingers, whilst the names of "The
Father, and the Son, and the Holy Ghost" are pronounced. Thus the third
is the first vacant finger, and the ring-finger. <i>The wedding-ring is
worn on the left hand to signify the subjection of the wife to her
husband.</i> The right hand signifies power, independence, authority;
according to the words:</p>

<div class="poem">

   <div class="stanza">

<p>"The salvation of his right hand is in powers."</p>

<p class="author">  Psalm xx. 6.</p>

</div>

 <div class="stanza">

<p> "The change of the right hand of the Most High."</p>

<p class="author">  Psalm lxxvii. 10.</p>

</div>
</div>


<p>The left hand signifies dependence or subjection. Married women, then,
wear the wedding-ring on the third finger of the left hand, because they
are subject to their husbands.</p>

<p>Bishops, because they have ecclesiastical authority, and doctors,
because they have authority to teach, wear the ring on the ring-finger
of the right hand.</p>

<h4>
<span><i>Count Königsmark</i> </span>
<span>(Vol. v., p. 78.).</span>
</h4>

<p>&mdash;The Queries put by M<span class="smcap lowercase">R.</span> M<span class="smcap lowercase">ARKLAND</span>
will be found solved in that excellent book, <i>The English Causes
Célèbres</i>, edited by Mr. Craik, and published in 1840. It is a great
pity that Mr. Craik's undertaking was not prosecuted beyond vol. i.</p>

<p>Walpole was wrong, and Sir Egerton Brydges right. Charles John Count
Königsmark was the instigator of the assassination of Mr. Thynne. Philip
Christopher von Königsmark, the younger brother of Charles John, was the
presumed lover of Sophia of Zell.</p>

<p>Charles John von Königsmark was mortally wounded at the battle of Argos,
on the 29th August, 1686.</p>

<p>The presumed "foul play" in the Königsmark case consisted, I suppose, in
Chief Justice Pemberton summing up strongly, in accordance with the
known wish of the king, that the Count should be acquitted.</p>

<p>M<span class="smcap lowercase">R</span>. M<span class="smcap lowercase">ARKLAND</span> will find his inquiries as to the two Königsmarks answered
in a late number of the <i>Quarterly Review</i> (I think that for October,
1851), in an article on the Lexington Papers.</p>

<h4>
<span><i>Petition respecting the Duke of Wellington</i> </span>
<span>(Vol. iv., pp. 233. 477.; Vol. v., p. 43.).</span>
</h4>

<p>&mdash;I thank Æ<span class="smcap lowercase">GROTUS</span> for the clue he has afforded me, as
to the date of the document he inquired for, and can now give him some
further particulars. At a Court of Common Council held Feb. 23, 1810, in
consequence of a proposition in the House of Commons to settle upon Lord
Wellington 2000<i>l.</i> per ann. for three lives, a motion was made, and
carried by sixty-five to fifty-eight, to petition the House against it.
The petition is very long, but it is to the following tenor: it
commences by objecting to the grant on the ground of economy, and that
his services have not deserved it; "that his gallant efforts in Portugal
have lead only to the disgraceful and scandalous Convention of Cintra,
signed by his own hand;" that the result of the battle of Talavera was a
retreat, with the abandonment of sick and wounded; that as yet they have
seen no inquiry into either of these campaigns; that he and his family
have held lucrative appointments in the East Indies; that no provision
has been made for the family of the highly deserving Sir John Moore. It
then goes on to say, "that it appears a high aggravation of the
misconduct of his Majesty's incapable and unprincipled advisers;" that
they advised his Majesty to refuse to receive from the Lord Mayor and
Sheriffs, either at a levee, or personal audience, a petition from the
livery praying an inquiry into the conduct of the commanders of the late
campaign. This is the substance of the petition which I should think
might be readily seen <i>in extenso</i> by a reference to a file of
newspapers of the date.</p>

  <p class="right">   E. N. W.</p>

<p class="left">   Southwark.</p>


<p>P.S.&mdash;The petition from the Livery, doubtless agreed to in Common Hall,
which the king refused to receive, and which is referred to above, is
most probably the one which Æ<span class="smcap lowercase">GROTUS</span> inquires about, and of which the
Duke complains in his dispatch of Jan. 1810. I have not been able to see
it; but if I can find it, will send you notes of it; the mem. I have
sent establishes the fact of its having been carried.</p>


<h4>
<span><i>Reichenbach's Ghosts</i> </span>
<span>(Vol. iv., p. 5.; Vol. v., p. 89.).</span>
</h4>

<p>&mdash;If A. N.
will do me the favour to refer to my question, he will see that his
remarks do not furnish a reply. Reichenbach says, that "thousands of
ghost stories will now receive a natural explanation," from his
discovery that the decomposition of animal matter is accompanied by
light, or luminous vapour, which is visible to certain sensitive
persons. As I originally stated, "my Query is, <i>where to find</i> the
'thousands of ghost stories' which are explained by it." I now repeat
that Query in unaffected ignorance. I have read a good many ghost
stories, British and foreign; but I know that some of the writers in "N.
&amp; Q." are much better acquainted with German literature and
superstitions than I am; and I ask them if they can tell me where to
find <i>such</i> stories,&mdash;that is, ghost stories explained by Reichenbach's
discovery? I do not ask for "thousands," nor even hundreds&mdash;a score or
two will be quite enough; or even a dozen, if they are good ones.</p>

<h4>
<span><i>The Broad Arrow.</i></span>
</h4>

<p>&mdash;I can only offer the following note on the above
subject as a conjecture,<a id="Page_116"></a>
 <span class="pagenum">[116]</span> probably most of your readers will think
a very wild one.</p>

<p>It has sometimes occurred to me that the origin of the symbol now
generally known as the "broad arrow" might be traced back to the
mysteries of Mithras. At all events, it is known that the same figure
occurs on coins, gems, &amp;c. as the symbol of Mithras as the <i>Sun</i>. Now,
so widely was the worship of Mithras spread throughout the Roman empire,
that I believe no one would feel any surprise at the adoption of a
Mithraic symbol even in the remotest parts of the empire; and indeed the
fact that Carausius, during his usurpation of the imperial authority in
Britain, issued coins with the inscription
 <span title="[Greek: Hêliô Mithra anikêtô]">&#7977;&#955;&#8055;&#8179; &#924;&#8055;&#952;&#961;&#8115;
 &#7936;&#957;&#953;&#954;&#8053;&#964;&#8179;</span>, brings the worship of Mithras, as it were, home to our own
doors. Whether the symbol of the sun was ever employed for any such
purpose as our modern broad arrow, is a question on which I hope some of
your readers may be able to throw some light. Meanwhile, being quite
ignorant as to the antiquity of our Ordnance mark, the above is merely
thrown out as a conjecture. It is perhaps, to some extent, confirmed by
a statement of Grimm's (<i>Deutsche Mythologie</i>), that the symbol of the
<i>Moon</i> was used by the ancient Germans precisely as our broad arrow,
viz. on boundary stones, &amp;c.</p>

<p>I think there is more probability in another conjecture of mine, that
the same symbol occurs elsewhere, and for a very different purpose, viz.
in our churches, and as symbolical of the Sun of Righteousness. Our
painted windows and our altar-cloths contain the symbol &#8593;,
which I believe generally goes by the name of the "three sacred
nails,"&mdash;an explanation which I always thought ridiculous, even at a
time when I could give no other. Is it not far more in accordance with
the principles of symbolism, and the practice of the early Christians,
to believe it to be the adoption of a heathen symbol, and its
application to Christian purposes?</p>

<h4>
<span><i>Quarter Waggoner</i> </span>
<span>(Vol. v., p. 11.).</span>
</h4>

<p>&mdash;I have met with a gentleman in
the navy who informs me that these words should be "Quarter Wagner," and
was so called from the publisher's name, "Wagner," who published the
charts in four parts answering to the four quarters of the globe. These
charts so called have been disused for near thirty years; and it was
commonly observed that they who did not make alteration by improvement
in the charts, or who knew not of anything beyond what was then known in
maritime affairs, did not know anything beyond what was noted on the
then existing charts by Wagner. Hence the phrase.</p>

<p class="right">  &#8224;</p>


<p>In connexion with the notes of B<span class="smcap lowercase">OLTON</span> C<span class="smcap lowercase">ORNEY</span>, I would mention that I
have a ponderous folio volume, with thick oak backs, covered with
canvas, on which is the name of the book, <i>The Dutch Waggoner</i>: the
printed title is&mdash;</p>

<p class="blockquot">"The Lightning Columne or Sea-Mirrour, containing the Sea-Coasts
   of the Northern, Eastern, and Western Navigation; Setting forth
   in divers necessarie Sea-Cards, all the Ports, Rivers, Bayes,
   Roads, Depths and Sands, very curiously placed on its due Polus
   heigt furnished, With the discoveries of the chief Countries, and
   on what cours and distance they lay one from another. Never
   theretofore so clearly laid open, and here and there very
   diligently bettered and augmented for the use of all Seamen. As
   also the Situation of the Northernly Countries, as Islands, the
   Strate Davids, the Isle of Jan Mayen, Bear's Island, Old
   Greenland, Spitzbergen and Nova Zembla: Adorned with many
   Sea-Cards and Discoveries, gathered out of the Experience and
   Practice of divers Pilots and Lovers of the famous Art of
   Navigation. Whereunto is added a brief Instruction of the Art of
   Navigation, together with New Tables of the Sun's Declination,
   wit an New Almanach. At Amsterdam. Printed by Casparus Loots-man,
   Bookseller upon the Water in the Loots-man, 1689. With previledge
   for fiftheen Iears."</p>

<p>The "priviledge" is signed "Arent Baron van Waggenaer. By the
appointment of the States, Symon van Beaumont." The book is full of very
curious charts, sections, and headlands, and other engravings, and is
very rare; but I merely mention it to show that books of charts, &amp;c.
<i>were</i> known as <i>waggoners</i>.</p>

<p class="right">   L. J<span class="smcap lowercase">EWITT</span>.</p>


<p>M<span class="smcap lowercase">R</span>. B<span class="smcap lowercase">OLTON</span> C<span class="smcap lowercase">ORNEY</span> has traced the "Waggoner" to Wagenaer's work
satisfactorily; but surely the <i>Quarter</i> is merely <i>Quarto</i>. I believe
the term is not now used in the navy, and apparently was never
<i>officially</i> recognised: at least it does not occur in the <i>Admiralty
Instructions for the Navy</i> of 1747, 1790, or 1808. I may add a reference
to Falconer's <i>Marine Dictionary</i>, where "Waggoner" is explained to be a
"book of charts, describing the coasts, rocks, &amp;c.," and to Dalrymple's
<i>Charts and Memoirs</i> (1772), where a work called <i>The English Waggoner</i>
is mentioned.</p>

<p><i>Log-book</i> is so called because the rate of sailing of the ship, as
ascertained by heaving the <i>log</i>, is one of the most frequent and
important entries.</p>

<h4>
<span><i>Cibber's Lives of the Poets</i></span>
<span> (Vol. v., p. 25.).</span>
</h4>

<p>&mdash;I have not Croker's
<i>last</i> edition of Boswell's <i>Life of Johnson</i> to refer to, to see what
is there said respecting Cibber's title to the authorship of this book;
but I find the following MS. note on the fly-leaf of the first volume of
my copy of the <i>Lives of the Poets</i>:&mdash;</p>

<p class="blockquot"> "Steevens says that not the smallest part of the work called
   'Cibber's <i>Lives of the Poets</i>' was the compilation of Cibber;
   being entirely written by Mr. Shiells, amanuensis to Dr. Johnson,
   when his Dictionary was preparing for the press. T. Cibber was in
   the King's Bench, and accepted of ten guineas from the
   booksellers<a id="Page_117"></a>
 <span class="pagenum">[117]</span> for leave to prefix his name to the work, and
   it was purposely so prefixed as to leave the reader in doubt
   whether he or his father was the person designed."</p>

<p>The American edition of the German <i>Conversations-Lexicon</i>, at vol. iii.
p. 190. makes the same statement, but without giving any authority. The
name of Robert Shiells, a Scotchman, is here given as the author of the
<i>Lives of the Poets</i>.</p>

 <p class="right">  P. T.</p>



<h4>
<span><i>Shakspere and the English Press</i> </span>
<span>(Vol. iv., p. 344.).</span>
</h4>

<p>&mdash;The <i>Second part
of Henry the Sixt</i>, ascribed to Shakspere by Heminge and Condell, is
founded on a play entitled <i>The first part of the contention betwixt the
two famous houses of Yorke and Lancaster</i>, which was first printed
anonymously in 1594. It was reprinted anonymously in 1600; and, as the
work of Shakspere, about 1619. The amended play first appeared in the
folio of 1623. The passage in which Jack Cade reproaches lord Say with
having promoted education, stands thus in the editions of 1594 and 1623:</p>

<p class="blockquot">"Thou hast most traitorously erected a grammer schoole, to infect
   the youth of the realme, and against the kings crowne and
   dignitie, thou hast built vp a paper-mill."&mdash;1594. (J. O. H.)</p>

<p class="blockquot">"Thou hast most traitorously corrupted the youth of the realm in
   erecting a grammar-school: and whereas, before, our forefathers
   had no other books but the score and the tally, thou hast caused
   printing to be used; and, contrary to the king, his crown, and
   dignity, thou hast built a paper-mill."&mdash;1623. (J. P. C.)</p>

<p>Fabian gives no information on the charges made against lord Say; nor do
the subsequent chroniclers. The received text contains two undoubted
anachronisms&mdash;to what extent, it would require a volume to decide. On
comparing the extracts, it appears that we must ascribe the anachronism
on paper-making to the earlier dramatist, and that on printing to
William Shakspere&mdash;who also borrowed the allusion to <i>the score and the
tally</i> from a former speech in the work of his unknown precursor.</p>

<p>Malone, when he edited <i>The plays and poems of William Shakspere</i>,
undertook to distinguish by inverted commas the lines of this play which
the poet "retouched and greatly improved," and by asterisks, those which
were "his own original production." The design was commendable, but in
the execution of it he committed numerous oversights.</p>

<h3>
<span>NOTES ON BOOKS, ETC.</span>
</h3>

<p><i>The Book of Familiar Quotations; being a Collection of Popular Extracts
and Aphorisms selected from the Works of the best Authors</i>, is a little
volume of such extracts from Shakspeare, Pope, and others of our
greatest poets as most frequently fall on the ear in conversation, or
meet the eye in the columns of the press and periodicals of the country.
The present selection is a very good one, as far as it goes, and has the
advantage over its predecessors of not only giving us the name of the
author of each passage quoted, but also its precise place in his works.</p>

<p><i>Shall we Register our Deeds? answered by Sir Edward Sugden.</i> This
clever pamphlet proposes an important Query, and replies to it thus:
"Let us therefore to the question proposed, Shall we register our deeds?
answer with one voice, No!"</p>

<p>If the study of Natural History be one which may with advantage be
introduced into the family circle (and who can doubt it?) we know no
better medium than the clever and well-conducted little weekly paper
which has just been commenced under the title of Kidd's <i>London
Journal</i>, of which the first five numbers are before us.</p>

<p>Mr. Tymms, the active and zealous Secretary of the <i>Bury and West
Suffolk Archæological Institute</i>, and Editor of the volume of <i>Bury
Wills</i>, printed by the Camden Society, is about to publish a <i>Handbook
of Bury</i>, on the plan of Cunningham's <i>Handbook of London</i>, and would be
glad to receive any notes upon the subject: more especially with respect
to its remarkable inhabitants.</p>

<p>We have to call the attention of our readers interested in the history
of our Constitution and Constitutional Law to a preliminary Essay on the
History of the <i>Law of Habeas Corpus</i> recently published by Dr.
Marquardsen, under the title <i>Ueber Haft und Bürgschaft bei den
Angelsachsen</i>. It is but a small pamphlet, but will repay the time spent
in its perusal. This mention of the Anglo-Saxon polity reminds us, that
the Second Part of <i>The Jubilee Edition of the Complete Works of King
Alfred</i> has been issued, and, in addition to a continuation of the
<i>Harmony of the Chronicles</i>, contains a <i>Sketch of the Anglo-Saxon
Mint</i>, and a <i>Description of all the Coins of King Alfred</i> now
remaining.</p>

<p class="center">Now Ready, Fourth Edition, Post 8vo., 15<i>s.</i></p>

<p class="noindent cap">VISITS to the MONASTERIES of the LEVANT. By the Hon. ROBERT CURZON, Jun.
With numerous Illustrations.</p>

<p class="blockquot"> "This work is a most welcome addition to the stock of 'Travels in
   the East,' and chiefly because it differs essentially from any
   which have ever before fallen under our notice, whether the
   subject-matter or the mode of handling it be considered. It
   treats of thoroughly out-of-the-way and almost untrodden spots
   and scenes, and in detailing the adventures which befel him in
   his rambles in the East in quest of ancient manuscripts, the
   author has contrived to present to the reader some eight and
